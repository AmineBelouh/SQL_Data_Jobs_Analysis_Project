# Background  

This project was created to better understand the data analyst job market, with the goal of identifying the highest-paying and most in-demand skills to help others find the best job opportunities.  

The dataset used is from Luke Barousse's app [datanerd.tech](https://datanerd.tech/).  

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:  

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used  

**SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.  
**PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system.  
**Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.  
**Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Analysis  

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market, with a focus on **remote offers**.  

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I ordered the data by average yearly salary in descending order.    


```sql
SELECT
    job_postings.job_id,
    job_postings.job_title,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_postings.job_location,
    job_postings.job_schedule_type,
    job_postings.salary_year_avg,
    job_postings.job_posted_date::DATE
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_postings.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_postings.job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND job_postings.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    job_postings.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs:  
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $255,829 to $445,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.   
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like Netflix, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.  
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.  

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs  

To see what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.  

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_postings.job_id,
        job_postings.job_title,
        company_dim.name AS company_name,
        job_postings.salary_year_avg
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact AS job_postings
    INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_postings.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_postings.job_location = 'Anywhere'
        AND job_postings.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 
        job_postings.salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;
```  

Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs:  
- **SQL** is leading with a count of 6.  
- **Python** follows with a count of 4.    
- Other skills like **Tableau** and **Excel** show varying degrees of demand.  

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts  

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings. 

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(job_postings.job_id) AS postings_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_postings.job_location = 'Anywhere'
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY 
    postings_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```   

| Skills   | Postings Count |

### 4. Skills Based on Salary  

Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.  

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_postings.job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND job_postings.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```  

Employers place a premium on niche expertise in emerging and in-demand technologies.
