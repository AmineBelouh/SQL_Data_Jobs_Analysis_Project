# Background  

This project was created to better understand the data analyst job market, with the goal of identifying the highest-paying and most in-demand skills to help others find the best job opportunities.  

The data comes from Luke Barousse's [SQL course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). Itâ€™s full of details on job titles, salaries, locations, and key skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:  

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used  

**SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.  
**PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system.  
**Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.  
**Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Analysis  

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market, with a focus on **remote offers**.  

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.  


```sql
SELECT
    job_postings.job_id,
    job_postings.job_title,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_postings.job_location,
    job_postings.job_schedule_type,
    job_postings.salary_year_avg,
    job_postings.job_posted_date::DATE
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_postings.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_postings.job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND job_postings.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
